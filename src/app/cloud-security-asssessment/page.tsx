These challenges stem from the shared responsibility model of cloud computing, where the cloud provider and the cloud user both have roles to play in ensuring security. Common challenges include Data Security, Identity and Access Management, Regulatory Compliance, APIs Vulnerabilities, Insider Threats and Cyberattacks.  Cloud environments are shared responsibility models where security configurations remain the customer's responsibility.  ",

          Our cloud security assessment follows the CIS (Center for Internet
          Security) Benchmark which involves a comprehensive review of an
          organization&apos;s adherence to a set of best practices for securing
          cloud environments. The CIS Benchmarks are globally recognized as
          standard guidelines for securing IT systems and data against cyber

          Cloud security is critically important for several reasons, as it
          plays a pivotal role in safeguarding an organization&apos;s data,
          applications, and infrastructure when using cloud computing services.
          Cloud security presents several challenges to protecting data, because
          although cloud providers have robust security measures,
          misconfigurations or weak access controls can be exploited by bad
          actors. And the proliferation of cloud services and resources can lead
          to “cloud sprawl”, making it even more challenging to track and secure
          all assets effectively.
